Introduction: 
Our program is a maze/dungeon game that spawns the player in a complicated maze. The player controls their character from a platformer game’s perspective. They are able to use the arrow or WASD keys on the keyboard to move around the maze. The player is a hero trying to find the exit of the maze. Along the way there are monsters and power ups. The player can pick up powerups that sometimes help them. The player has a certain amount of lives such as 3 and for each unsuccessful fight or encounter with a monster, the player loses a life which means the player will die and the game ends when they run out of lives. Our program is designed for students and players who like to play games and want to try a puzzle-like action game. 


Instructions:




* Enter on a screen that has the title and a button that says start game, click on this
* Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the player around the maze.
* Use the spacebar to use your ability (if you’ve picked one up)
* Try to reach the ‘X’ which represents the exit












Features List (THE ONLY SECTION THAT CANNOT CHANGE LATER):
Must-have Features:


*  There will be a GUI: Images represent the parts of the maze and all its components, as well as the characters and enemies represented on screen by images. 
*  User input (keyboard): The user can use the arrow keys or wasd to control the character as they move around the maze and to interact with elements like monsters or powerups
* There are power ups that the player can collect by touching them. There’ll be several power ups that change how the user can progress through the game like increasing movement, changing how much maze is visible.  Powerups: grant temporary more movespeed, vision, etc
* Monsters are also in the maze and can hurt/kill the player. The player can avoid the monsters or attack them. Player has a limited amount of health/lives and will be killed after a certain amount of bad encounters with monsters. Different monsters will have a different AI and have different behavior.
* The character can freely walk on the screen, not bound to a grid, but cannot walk out of bounds or through walls. 


Want-to-have Features:


*  Random level generation (good: spend less time making levels, bad: spend time making winnable random levels) [a]
*  Pick up weapons to fight the monsters that are encountered [b][c]
*  Pick up advanced tools for skills like going through a wall or going invisible etc
*  Make different types of monsters and give them ability to move in a random computer generated way in a certain part of the maze[d]
*  Option for 2-player but local (not great for this remote learning tho)


Stretch Features:


*  First Person, make the maze in first person perspective and render the maze and everything 3D to make it more difficult
*  Maze has levels that randomly generate, and becomes more and more difficult
*  Monetary system to buy gear/characterskins/permanent power ups etc
* Leaderboard feature over firebase of fastest completion time
